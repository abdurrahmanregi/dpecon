Dynamic Programming for Economics
=================================

This is a collection of code files that solve various economic models using dynamic programming. It is intended as a reference for economists who are getting started with solving economic models numerically.

The code is written in MATLAB, a programming language developed by MathWorks. MathWorks sells a piece of software (also called MATLAB) for writing and running MATLAB code, and most economics departments will have licenses for it. However, to run the code included in this collection you do *not* need to have a MATLAB license. All the code is written to be compatible with GNU Octave, a free software alternative to MATLAB. Where certain MATLAB features are not implemented in Octave, I provide alternative files with the suffix "_octave".
